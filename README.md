All the Google Scripts tools!

A collection of Google Scripts I created or adapted while working for a civil engineering firm. 


<strong>Email Reminders by Row:</strong>
- A tool created to send email reminders for tasks due at onboarding.
- It's fairly limited in scope, currently. Would like to add more functionality through a sidebar interface.

<strong>New Spreadsheets from Query Data:</strong>
- Used to sort through a set of data from a project database. The projects needed to be sorted according to the project manager and then separated into individual spreadsheets so they could review. 
- Filtered using a query formula built within the script for each project manager. 
- Used for a specific purpose, likely won't need again, so probably won't make more functional.
